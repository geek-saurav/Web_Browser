## PyQt5 Web Browser
This is a simple web browser application built using PyQt5 and QtWebEngineWidgets that allows users to navigate to websites, go back/forward, reload, and view their current URL.

### Installation:
To use this application, you'll need to have PyQt5 installed. You can install it using pip:
`pip install PyQt5`

### Usage:
